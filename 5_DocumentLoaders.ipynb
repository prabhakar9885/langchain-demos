      "Introduction  \n",
      "1. The Indian  economy  has witnessed profound positive \n",
      "transformation in the last ten years. The people of India are \n",
      "looking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.  \n",
      "2. With the blessings of the people, when our Government \n",
      "under the visionary and dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime \n",
      "Minister Shri Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, the country \n",
      "was facing enormous challenges. With ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka \n",
      "Vikas’  as its ‘mantra’ , the Government overcame those \n",
      "challenges in right earnest. Structural reforms were undertaken. \n",
      "Pro-people programmes were formulated and implemented \n",
      "promptly. Conditions were cr eated for more opportunities for \n",
      "employment and entrepreneurship. The economy got a new \n",
      "vigour. The fruits of development started reaching the people at \n",
      "scale. The country got a new sense of purpose and hope. \n",
      "Naturally, the people blessed the Government wi th a bigger \n",
      "mandate.  2 \n",
      " 3. In the second term, our Government under the leadership \n",
      "of Hon’ble Prime Minister doubled down on its responsibilities to \n",
      "build a prosperous country with comprehensive development of \n",
      "all people and all regions. Our Government strengthened its \n",
      "‘mantra’  to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas’. Our \n",
      "development philosophy covered all elements of inclusivity, \n",
      "namely,  \n",
      " social inclusivity through coverage of all strata of the \n",
      "society, and  \n",
      " geographical  inclusivity through development of all \n",
      "regions of the country.   \n",
      "4. With the ‘whole of nation’ approach of ‘Sabka Prayas’, t he \n",
      "country overcame the challenge of a once -in-a-century \n",
      "pandemic, took long strides towards ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, \n",
      "committed to ‘Panch  Pran’ , and laid solid foundations for the  \n",
      "‘Amrit Kaal’. As a result, our young country has high aspiration s, \n",
      "pride in its present, and hope and confidence for a bright future. \n",
      "We expect that our Government , based on  its stupendous work , \n",
      "will be blessed ag ain by the people with a resounding mandate.  \n",
      "Inclusive Development and Growth  \n",
      "5. Our humane and inclusive approach to development is a \n",
      "marked and deliberate departure from the earlier approach of \n",
      "‘provisioning up -to-village level’. Development programmes , in \n",
      "the last ten years, have targeted each and every household and \n",
      "individual, through ‘housing for all’, ‘har ghar jal’ , electricity for 3 \n",
      " all, cooking gas for all, bank accounts and financial services for \n",
      "all, in record time.  \n",
      "6. The worries about food have been eliminated through free \n",
      "ration for 80 crore people. Minimum support prices for the \n",
      "produce of ‘Annadata’    are periodically increased appropriately. \n",
      "These and the provision of basic necessities have enhanced real \n",
      "income in the rural areas. Their econo mic needs could be \n",
      "addressed, thus spurring growth and generating jobs.   \n",
      "Social Justice   \n",
      "7. Our Government  is working with an approach to \n",
      "development that is  all-round, all -pervasive and all -inclusive \n",
      "(सर्वांगीण , सर्वस्पर्शी  और सर्वसमवर्ेर्शी ). It covers all castes and \n",
      "people at all levels. We are working to make India a ‘Viksit \n",
      "Bharat’ by 2047. For achieving that goal, we need to improve \n",
      "people’s capability and empower them.  \n",
      "8. Previously, social justice was mostly a political slogan. For \n",
      "our Gov ernment, social justice is an effective and necessary \n",
      "governance model. The saturation approach of covering all \n",
      "eligible people is the true and comprehensive achievement of \n",
      "social justice. This is secularism in action, reduces corruption, \n",
      "and prevents nepo tism (भवई-भतीजवर्वद ). There is transparency \n",
      "and assurance that benefits are delivered to all eligible people.  \n",
      "The resources are distributed fairly . All, regardless of their social \n",
      "standing, get access to opportunities. We are addressing \n",
      "systemic inequaliti es that had plagued our society. We focus on 4 \n",
      " outcomes and not on outlays so that the socio -economic \n",
      "transformation is achieved.   \n",
      "9. As our Prime Minister firmly believes , we need to focus on \n",
      "four major castes. They are, ‘Garib’ (Poor) , ‘Mahilayen’ \n",
      "(Women),  ‘Yuva’  (Youth) and   ‘Annadata’ (Farmer). Their needs, \n",
      "their aspirations, and their welfare are our highest priority. The \n",
      "country progresses, when they progress. All four require and \n",
      "receive government support in their quest to better their lives. \n",
      "Their empo werment and well -being will drive the country \n",
      "forward.  \n",
      "Garib Kalyan, Desh ka Kalyan  \n",
      "10. We believe in empowering the poor. The earlier approach \n",
      "of tackling poverty through entitlements had resulted in very \n",
      "modest outcomes. When the poor become empowered partners \n",
      "in the development process, government’s power to assist them \n",
      "also increases mani fold. With the pursuit of ‘Sabka ka Saath’  in \n",
      "these 10 years , the Government has assisted 25 crore people to \n",
      "get freedom from multi -dimensional poverty. Our Government’s \n",
